# QR Yard Sign
Hey neighbor. Thank you for taking the time to snap a picture of this sign.

## About
Some of the problems with yard signs include:
 - Static/Immutable in nature
 - Have limited utility after being printed
 - Have limited space and can only convey small bits of information
 - Are placed in the yard and are subsequently ignored by posters and readers
 - Often use other people's words to support a position
 - Mass produced and impersonal
 - Tends to be devisive in nature
 - Lends themselves to no real dialgoue (one-way communication)

It is my hope that this little experiment changes some of that. IF you see this sign, or if this sign has changed positions within my yard, there is a good chance that it will link to timely information. Or pictures of my dog -- either way, a win-win situation.
